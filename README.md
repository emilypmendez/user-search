# User Search App

## Cadence Labs Front End Developer Challenge

Written by [Emilypmendez](github.com/emilypmendez)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

================================================

## Available Scripts

Start by installing node modules with `npm install`
Then, in the project directory, you can run: `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

================================================

## Challenges and Overcoming Them

- Challenge # 1: Setting up the search bar was challenging due to mapping and filtering for certain data points.
- Challenge # 2: Building the style and construction of the list of profile cards took a significant amount of time to get right.

## Design Decisions

- The wireframe provided a great reference for determining parent and child components.
- Functionality is carried throughout the app components infrastructure.

## Future Improvements (with more time)

================================================

## Other Relevant Info

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
